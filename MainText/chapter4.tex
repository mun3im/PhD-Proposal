\chapter{Conclusion}

The study aims to contribute a low-power bird recognizer which can be implemented on low-resource IoT edge devices. 
Power-efficiency against accuracy of CNNs will be investigated.
These contributions could expand the use of machine learning at edge.
In environmental studies, the results should eventually slow down the biodiversity loss facing our planet.
