What is different?

\begin{itemize}
\item Not using ImageNet-class CNN which are too big
\item Cascade classifier to improve accuracy and power consumption
\item Binary first-stage classifier to minimize static power
\item Small lightweight CNN second-stage with just enough features
\item Application of spectral image features (SIF)
\item Measurement of power to compute each inference
\item Mapping of classifier to platform
\item Platform recommendations
\item Possible additional work: FFT-based audio compression and IoT proof-of-concept (RasPi and Portenta)
\end{itemize}
