\section{Bird Recognition}

%\end{figure}

Birds are important indicators of the health of the environment. 
The traditional method of bird monitoring is by point counts where an observer records all birds seen and heard at a fixed location \cite{Shonfield2017}.
Since birds are easily detected by sound, using bird recognition based on acoustic signals can augment or even supplant the point count method \citep{Kuaga2019}.

Passive acoustic monitors (PAMs) also known as autonomous recording units (ARUs) left on site can continuously capture audio recordings and offer many advantages over field observers \citep{Digby2013,Sugai2019}.
The sounds are processed through spectrogram reading and/or listening by experienced observers.
Due to sheer volume of data, it is not feasible to manually process weeks' or monthsâ€™ worth of recordings.
The trend today is towards automatic recognition \citep{Aide2013}.

Bird vocalizations can be classified as songs and calls. Songs attract mates and advertise territories during the breeding season in songbirds. Calls are used during foraging, social and antipredator communications. Songs and calls can differ substantially in time and frequency components \cite{Velez2015}.

\begin{figure}%[h]

\includegraphics[scale=1]{birdrecognitionmodules}
\caption{Modules for bird species recognition.}
\label{birdrecognitionmodules}
\end{figure}

A typical workflow for identifying birds by sound is shown in Fig. \ref{birdrecognitionmodules}.
The first module records bird sounds into \textit{wav} format and divides the sound into fixed length frames.
A feature vector is generated from each frame for the next module. Next, the bird activity detector selects only frames which contain bird vocalizations to be passed on the classification stage. The other parts of the sound are discarded. This stage increases classification accuracy \cite{Stastny2018}. Finally the classification stage identifies the bird species.

%The remainder of this section compares classifiers used for bird recognition task. Finally, the various features can be extracted from sound, focusing on time-frequency image-based representation.


\subsection{Classifiers}

Bird detection is such an interesting challenge that several competitions are held regularly to find the best classifier algorithm. 
One such competition is BirdCLEF, held annually by the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF). 
Table \ref{birdclefwinners} lists the winners since 2015.
Since 2016, all winners have been using classifiers based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Outside of BirdCLEF, other researchers have also found CNN to consistently outperform other classifiers in most use cases.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Due to the clear advantage of CNN, this proposal will proceed with the discussion of CNN and its application to sound event detection.

\subsection{Features}

CNN works on two-dimensional images.
Bird sounds are one-dimensional signal representations.
Sounds are commonly converted to two-dimensional representations or spectrograms before any processing by CNN.
This section discusses spectrograms and its variations.

\subsubsection{Spectrogram}

A spectrogram in an image produced by applying the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to a windowed signal.
The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) computes the frequency and phase contents of a signal over time. 
The Fourier transform of a signal is taken by multiplying a window function for a short period of time:

\[
\mathrm{STFT}\{x(t)\}(\tau,\omega) \equiv X(\tau,\omega) = \int^\infty_\infty x(t)\omega(t-\tau)e^{-i\omega t}dt
\]

\noindent
where $\omega(\tau)$ is the window function, commonly a Hamming or Hanning windows centered around zero, and $x(t)$ is the signal to be transformed.

In the discrete version of STFT, the data to be transformed is split into frames. Frames usually overlap to reduce the effects of windowing. Mathematically, it is:

\[
\mathrm{STFT}\{x[n]\}(m,\omega) \equiv X(m,\omega) = \sum^\infty_{n=-\infty} x[n]\omega[n-m]e^{-j\omega t}dt
\]

\noindent
where $x[n]$ is the signal, and $\omega[n]$ is the window. Discrete-time STFT is typically performed on computer using optimized routines called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Fig. \ref{koel} shows the time representation and spectrogram equivalent of an Asial koel.

     \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Asian koel bird call in time and frequency representations.}
    \label{koel}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)}

Humans do not perceive frequency in a linear manner because the ears becomes less selective as frequency increase above 1 kHz. The Mel scale was developed to compensate for this.
MFCC works well with human voice and to a major extent on bird sounds because the sound production mechanisms of human and birds have some similarities. The approximate expression for the Mel scale is:

\[
F_\mathrm{mel} = \frac{1000}{log(2)} \cdot \left[1+\frac{F_\mathrm{Hz}}{1000}\right]
\]


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{mel-hz-plot}
    \caption{Mel-Hz plot.}
    \label{mel-hz-plot}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{mfcc}
    \caption{Computation of MFCC.}
    \label{mfcc}
\end{figure}

The relationship between Mel scale and linear frequency  is illustrated in Fig. \ref{mel-hz-plot}.
For each frame of speech signal, a MFCC vector is computed as illustrated in Fig. \ref{mfcc}. The spectrum is passed through the Mel filter bank. Then the logarithm of the filter bank output is transformed by applying the discrete cosine transform (DCT). DCT decorrelates the extracted features facilitating the extraction of salient features. Typically MFCC is represented by the first 13 coefficients of the Mel cepstrum.


\subsubsection{Mel Spectrogram}

The mel spectrogram are computed similar to MFCC but without computing the discrete cosine transform. For some applications, the mel spectrogram produced results comparable to MFCC \cite{Lasseck2018}.

\subsubsection{Cochleagram}

Gammatone is another filter inspired by human hearing. The filter bank simulates the cochlea, and the produced spectrum is sometimes called the cochleagram \cite{Xie2017}. The Gammatone Frequency cepstral coefficients (GFCC) are computed as in Fig. \ref{gfcc}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{gfcc}
    \caption{Computation of GFCC.}
    \label{gfcc}
\end{figure}

The spectrum is passed through the Gammatone filter bank. Then loudness compression and DCT are applied. GFCCs are the first 22 feature extracted.

\subsubsection{Spectrogram Image Features (SIF)}

In spectrogram image features (SIF), features are extracted from the visual signature of the spectrogram. Taking advantage of the fact that spectrograms appear as recognisable images to humans, a spectrogram is mapped into several images with different dynamic ranges. The separate images are again partitioned into $9 \times 9$ blocks, and image moments are computed for each block. This method is robust to noise \cite{Dennis2010}. SIF is not applicable to CNNs as the the features extracted from spectrograms are used for classifications and the features no longer look like images expected by CNNs.

%Detect the bird vocalizations using \cite{Fodor2013}, \cite{Lasseck2015} and \cite{Potamitis2015}.

Other features that are commonly used with bird sounds include constant-Q transform (CQT), LPCC, fundamental frequency, zero crossing rate, spectral flux, spectral centroid and spectral flatness.

\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) -- also called ConvNets or CNNs -- are popular because they work well in difficult tasks such as image classification and object detection.

\subsection{Elements of CNN}

A typical CNN is illustrated in Fig. \ref{typicalcnn}. The three types of layers in convolutional neural network are convolution layer, pooling layer and fully connected layer.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.33]{typicalcnn}
\caption{An example of typical CNN with two convolution
layers, two pooling layers and two fully-connected (fc) layers.

and the relative tensor size presents actual data volume \cite{Chen2016}.}
\label{typicalcnn}
\end{figure}

%Chen2016

\subsubsection*{Convolution Layer}

A convolution layer transforms the input image in order to extract features from it.
The input image is convolved with a kernel (or filter).
The two-dimensional output array from this operation is the output feature map.

A kernel is a small matrix which slides across the height and width of the  input image.
The dot product of the kernel and the image are computed at every spatial position producing the feature map.
The length by which the kernel slides is known as the stride length.

Color images have multiple channels, namely red, green, and blue, often referred to as the depth of the image.
A single color image is processed as three images by a convolutional layer.
Separate kernels are applied for each channel and the size of all the kernels must be the same.
The the output feature maps are stacked one after the other to create an output so that the number of channels is equal to the number of filters used. 

Finally to make up a convolution layer, a bias is added and an activation function is applied to increase the non-linearity in the output.
Traditionally, hyperbolic tangent or logistic sigmoid have been used. Today,  the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is more common as it computes faster while retaining sufficient discriminatory properties.

\subsubsection*{Pooling Layer}

Pooling layer is used to reduce the size of the representations and to speed up calculations, as well as to make some of the features it detects a bit more robust.
Typically pooling operations are maximum pooling and average pooling.
Maximum pooling extracts the maximum of a given kernel. 
On the other hand, average pooling computes the average of given kernel instead.

\subsubsection*{Fully-Connected Layer}

A fully-connected (FC) or dense layer integrates mid-level features at different spatial locations into a high-level representation, and at the same time, the last fully-connected layer is the classifier to rank the possibility of each class.

A fully-connected layer fuses locally extracted features from convolution layers into a high-level representative, and fully-connected layer utilizes a linear projection approach to map high-dimension feature vector to dense but low-dimension feature vector.

\subsection{CNN Complexity}

Calculating the number of parameters and operations enables different CNNs to compared in terms of computational complexity. This in turn enables the estimation of energy required for each inference.

A convolutional layer has these parameters: $C$, $Y$ and $X$  are channel, height and width of the input image, $H$ and $W$ are height and width of one kernel, and $N$, $Y'$ and $X'$ are channel, height and width of the output feature map.
The number of features to learn is $N\times C \times H \times W$.
The number additions required is then $(C\times H\times W-1)\times N\times Y'\times X'$ and the number of multiplications is $(C\times H\times W)\times N\times Y'\times X'$.

%For each feature map, a bias is added. Therefore, the total number of parameters is $(n\times m\times l+1)\times k$.

The size of the output feature map of a convolutional layer is found by $\mathit{input\_size}-(\mathit{filter\_size}-1)$. Normally padding is added to match the sizes, so that the expression becomes $\mathit{input\_size}+2\times \mathit{padding\_size}- (\mathit{filter\_size}-1)$.

The pooling layers has no parameters to learn. Its function is to reduce the image dimension.

In the fully-connected layer, all inputs has a trainable weight from each output of the previous layer. Therefore, for $M$ inputs and $N$ outputs, number of parameters and number of multiplications is $M\times N$. The number of additions is $(M - 1)\times N$ as we only need $n-1$ operations to add $n$ numbers.
The same calculation applies to the output layer as the output layer is fully-connected.

Table \ref{tabops} summarizes the number of operations and parameters required by different layer types.

Pooling		& $(H\times W-1) \times C \times Y'\times X'$

			& 0 \\
Fully-connected	& $(M-1)\times N$
			& $M\times N$
			& $M\times N$ \\
\bottomrule				
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{ImageNet-class CNN}

ImageNet is a large dataset containing more than 14 million high-resolution hand-labeled images in 22 thousand classes.
Since 2010, ImageNet runs the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) \cite{Russakovsky2015}.
This competition uses a subset of ImageNetâ€™s images to challenge researchers to train a model that can correctly classify an input image into 1,000 separate object categories.
Models are trained on 1.2 million training images, 150,000 testing images and 50,000 validation images

The popularity of CNNs started when the AlexNet model achieved called a large drop in error rate in the ILSVRC \cite{Krizhevsky2012} in 2012. AlexNet achieved a Top-5 error rate (rate of not finding the correct class among its top 5 predictions) of 15.3\%. The next best result was at 26.2\%.

In bioacoustic studies, ImageNet-class CNNs have been used to classify frogs \cite{Xie2017}, birds \cite{Sankupellay2018} and whales \cite{Thomas2019}. 

The drawbacks of ImageNet-class CNNs are (1) they are very slow to train, and (2) the weights are very large in term of memory requirements. These drawbacks also make them unsuitable for embedded or mobile deployment. The SqueezeNet and MobileNet CNN families are designed to address these issues \cite{Iandola2016,Howard2017}. By adjusting the size of input image and configuration of layers, several variations of the basic CNN can be deployment making tradeoffs in accuracy.

\section{Machine Learning and Edge Computing}

The edge computing paradigm, where compute nodes are located close to or at the edge devices, enable novel applications and services including machine learning (ML) at the edge.
To achieve machine learning at the edge, two models of computation can be identified.
The first model is the cloud-based inference where the data is uploaded to a the cloud and the device receives computation results. The second model is local computation which performs machine learning at the edge device.


\begin{figure}[b]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{edgeinference}
	\caption{Cloud inference vs edge inference.}
	\label{edgeinference}
\end{figure}

Cloud-based inference utilize servers with high resources and virtual limitless capacity. 
However, cloud-based inference has a number of drawbacks. First, cloud-based inference requires twice the energy compared to local processing. Second is latency. Sending data to the cloud and waiting for result may incur delays which cause real-time applications to fail. Some applications will be totally non-functional if the network is congested or unavailable. Third is privacy as data may leaked during network transfer \citep{Lane2016}. Lastly, cloud-based inference causes scalability issues. Much of the data send to the cloud do not useful information contributing to inefficient network utilization  \cite{Chen2019}.
Fig. \ref{edgeinference} illustrates these differences.

Many applications require only a fixed trained model for inference.
Training the model can be performed offline by at the cloud.
Edge devices perform the necessary inference and send only positive detections to the cloud.

In bioacoustic monitoring, continuous observations is a must to capture rare events.
Storage limitations of PAMs and communication overheads of cloud-based inference impose limitations on continuous real-time monitoring.
Performing inference at the edge and using low-power long-range radio communications such as LoRa seems able to solve the limitations mentioned above \cite{Ayele2018}.

\subsection{Machine Learning Hardware}

This sections lists representative hardware that have been deployed for machine learning at the edge.

\subsubsection{Raspberry Pi}

The Raspberry Pi single board computer (SBC) is the most common devices for edge computing. It can run ML without extra hardware \cite{Xu2018}. The most powerful version is Raspberry Pi 4 running quad-core Cortex-A72 ARM at 1.5 GHz. It can contain up 4GB SDRAM enabling quite a substantial CNN to be implemented. SBCs have the advantage of being easy to used as they run embedded Linux and can be programmed using C, C++ or Python.

\subsubsection{Nvidia Jetson}

The Nvidia Jetson family of devices are programmable hardware containing graphical processing units (GPUs) specially designed to run ML algorithms \cite{Otterness2017}. Each GPU is supervised by an on-board ARM CPU. Three versions are available: TK1, TX1 and TX2. These platforms have high performance but consumes more power and require specialized training to use.

\subsubsection{Intel Movidius}

The Intel Movidius is an  ultra-low-power system-on-chip (SoC) containing hardware specially designed to run ML algorithms. This device as a co-processor and is usually paired with the Raspberry Pi to ML tasks \cite{Andri2017}.

\subsubsection{Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)}

Field-programmable gate arrays are reconfigurable hardware devices that has better power-efficiency than CPUs. At least one study has applied the FPGA for bird recognition \cite{Hervas2017}. The most powerful device for CNNs is the Intel Arria 10 which contains hardware floating-point units \cite{Aydonat2017}. FPGAs commonly embed hardware ARM CPUs to supervise the reconfigurable hardware. FPGAs used to require programming in hardware description languages such as Verilog but frameworks such as OpenCL are faciliting FPGA use among non-hardware designers. Intel and Xilinx supply most of the FPGAs in use today.

\subsubsection{Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)}

Application-specific integrated circuits are silicon devices which can implement ML in hardware in the most power-efficient way. They require extensive hardware expertise to design. ASICs have been used for the keyword spotting task \cite{Price2018, Liu2019}.

\subsection{Power-Efficient CNN Inference}

Other than large memory requirements, the other obstacle in implementing deep neural networks in embedded systems high power consumption. Power consumption is directly related to the number of multiply and acummulate operations required. Table \ref{power} lists the power consumption for different operations and sizes of operands.


\begin{table}[h]
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}
\small

\caption{Energy consumption in multiply-accumulations at 45nm feature size \cite{Horowitz2014}.}

32-bit integer      &3.1pJ  &0.1pJ \\
16-bit floating-point&1.1pJ &0.4pJ \\
32-bit floating-point&3.7pJ &0.9pJ\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Small CNNs}

One approach to power efficiency is to build CNNs knowing the effects of design decision on power.
In the SqueezeNext model, power is reduced by removing operations that do not contribute to accuracy \cite{Gholami2018}. SqueezeNeXt design variations are more 2x faster and power efficient than the already small MobileNet.


A more popular approach to power efficiency is to build CNNs with just enough complexity to match the application at hand. Table \ref{customcnn} lists CNNs that work with spectrograms. They do not use the typical $224\times 224$ or $227\times 227$ image size used by ImageNet-class CNNs. Instead, the inputs are much wider and shorter to match the shape of spectrograms.

\subsubsection{Binarized Neural Networks}

Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are deep neural networks that use binarized weights and activations, rather than full precision values \cite{Courbariaux2015}.
They are less accurate than full precision networks but they are closing the accuracy gap (Fig. \ref{bnn-challenge}).
BNNs achieve low power due to much reduced logic switching.
Fig. \ref{bnn-advantage} compares standard convolution with BNNs.


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{bnn-challenge}

    \label{bnn-advantage}
\end{figure}

BNNs achieve the best efficiency when implemented on FPGA and ASIC. These target devices can be specified to use any operand size leaving no redundant bits. Additionally, multiply and add operations can be replaced with XNOR and population count operations, respectively, substantially reducing the amount of logic circuit.  See Fig. \ref{bnn-popcount}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Cascade Classifiers}

Power consumption can be reduced by turning off unnecessary circuits until needed.
Cascade classifiers implement this idea using two classifiers back-to-back.
The first classifier is a `weak' binary classifier which does not have to be very accurate.
A  positive detection activates the second classifier to perform the full multi-class identification.


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{two-stage-classifier-gray}
\caption{Cascade audio classifier.}
\label{two-stage-classifier-gray}
\end{figure}

On the iPhone implementation of the cascade classifier, an always-on processor (AOP) listens to the phrase ``Hey, Siri''.
When the wake-up word is detected, the AOP wakes up the mobile phone enabling more complex speech recognition tasks which require sending voice signals to the cloud \cite{Sigtia2018}.
For the simpler keyword spotting application, the cascade architecture has been implemented on digital signal processor (DSP) \citep{Gruenstein2017} and ASIC \cite{Price2018, Yin2018}.
This architecture has so far not yet applied for bird recognition.
		


\section{Conclusion}

This chapter establishes the context of the research topic.
The importance of automated bird recognition by acoustic methods is outlined.
For bird recognition to be effective on edge devices, it is proposed that a cascade classifier can achieve good performance at low power consumption.
This is the direction taken in the methodology chapter.
